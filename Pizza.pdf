Pizza
Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish  typically consisting of a
flat base of leavened  wheat-based dough  topped with
tomato , cheese , and other ingredients, baked at a
high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven .
The term pizza  was first recorded in 997 AD, in a
Latin  manuscript from the southern Italian  town of
Gaeta , in Lazio, on the border with Campania .[2]
Raffaele Esposito  is often credited for creating the
modern pizza in Naples .[3][4][5][6] In 2009,
Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European
Union  as a traditional speciality guaranteed  (TSG)
dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was
included on UNESCO 's list of intangible cultural
heritage .[8]
Pizza and its variants are among the most popular
foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of
restaurants, including pizzerias  (pizza specialty
restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants , via
delivery , and as street food .[9] In Italy, pizza served
in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten
with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual
settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be
eaten while held in the hand . Pizza is also sold in
grocery stores  in a variety of forms, including frozen
or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven .
In 2017, the world pizza market was US$ 128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over
76,000 pizzerias.[12] Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on
any given day.[13]
The oldest recorded usage of the word pizza  is thought to be from May 997 CE, appearing in the
Codex diplomaticus Caietanus , a notarial Latin  document from the town of Gaeta , then still part of
the Byzantine Empire .[14] The text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of
Gaeta duodecim pizze  (lit. 'twelve pizzas '),[15] a pork shoulder  and kidney annually on Christmas
Day, and twelve pizzas and a couple of chickens annually on Easter Sunday .[16]
Suggested etymologies include:Etymology An illustration from 1830 of a
pizzaiolo in NaplesByzantine Greek  and Late Latin  pitta > pizza , cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and
Calabrian (then Byzantine Italy ) pitta,[ 1 7 ] a round ﬂat bread baked in the oven at high
temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be traced to either Ancient
Greek  πικτή ( pikte ), 'fermented pastry', which in Latin became picta , or Ancient Greek πίσσα
(pissa , Attic: πίττα, pitta), 'pitch',[ 1 8 ] [ 1 9 ] or πήτεα ( pḗtea ), 'bran' (πητίτης, pētítēs , 'bran
bread').[ 2 0 ]
The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language  explains it as coming from dialectal pinza ,
'clamp', as in modern Italian pinze , 'pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps'. Their origin is from Latin
pinsere , 'to pound, stamp'.[ 2 1 ]
The Lombardic  word bizzo  or pizzo , meaning 'mouthful' (related to the English words bit and
bite), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading
Lombards .[ 2 ] [ 2 2 ] The shift b→ p could be explained by the High German consonant shift , and it
has been noted in this connection that in German the word Imbiss  means 'snack'.
A small pizza is sometimes called  pizzetta .[23] A person who makes pizza is known as a
pizzaiolo .[24]
The word pizza  was borrowed from Italian into English in the 1930s; before it became well known,
pizza was called "tomato pie" by English speakers. Some regional pizza variations still use the
name tomato pie.[25]
Records of pizza-like foods can be found throughout ancient
history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian  soldiers of the
Achaemenid Empire  during the rule of Darius the Great  baked
flatbreads with cheese and dates  on top of their battle
shields[26][27] and the ancient Greeks  supplemented their
bread with oils, herbs , and cheese .[28][29] An early reference to
a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid , when Celaeno, queen of
the Harpies , foretells that the Trojans would not find peace
until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In
Book VII, Aeneas  and his men are served a meal that includes
round cakes (such as pita bread) topped with cooked
vegetables. When they eat the bread , they realize that these are
the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno.[30] In 2023, archeologists
discovered a fresco in Pompeii  appearing to depict a pizza-like
dish among other foodstuffs and staples on a silver platter.
Italy's culture minister said it "may be a distant ancestor of the
modern dish".[31][32] The first mention of the word pizza
seemingly comes from a notarial document written in Latin
and dating to 997 CE from Gaeta , demanding a payment of
"twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on
Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on
Easter Day".[16]
Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples , Italy, in the 18th or early 19th
century.[33] Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard,
and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting
claims,[33] although it certainly could not have been before the 16th century and the ColumbianHistory Exchange . Pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries until about 1830, when
pizzerias in Naples started to have stanze  with tables where clients could sit and eat their pizzas on
the spot.[34]
A popular legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita ,[35] was invented in 1889, when
the Royal Palace of Capodimonte  commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo  ('pizza maker ') Raffaele
Esposito  to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita . Of the three different pizzas
he created, the queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the color s of the Italian flag—red
(tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Supposedly, this type of pizza was then named
after the queen,[36] with an official letter of recognition from the queen's "head of service"
remaining to this day on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.[37] Later
research cast doubt on this legend , undermining the authenticity of the letter of recognition,
pointing that no media of the period reported about the supposed visit and that both the story and
name Margherita were first promoted in the 1930s–1940s.[38][39]
Pizza was taken to the United States by Italian immigrants  in the late 19th century[40] and first
appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's , opened in
New York City in 1905.[41] Italian Americans migrating from East to West brought the dish with
them, and from there, the American version was exported to the rest of the world.[42]
The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit. 'True Neapolitan Pizza Association ') is a non-profit
organization  founded in 1984 with headquarte rs in Naples that aims to promote traditional
Neapolitan pizza .[43] In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with  the
European Union  as a traditional speciality guaranteed  (TSG) dish,[44][45] and in 2017 the art of its
making was included on UNESCO 's list of intangible cultural heritage .[8]
Pizza is sold fresh or frozen , and whole or in portion-size slices . Methods have been developed to
overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing
a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw
ingredients and self-rising crusts.
In the US, another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias . This pizza is assembled
in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens . Some grocery stores sell
fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.

In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks  above the heat source, an electric
deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven . The pizza
is slid into the oven on a long paddle, called "peel ", and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a
round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the oven surface is. Before use, a peel is
typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it.[46] When made at
home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone  in a regular oven to reproduce som e of the heating
effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the
crust, burning it.[47] Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As
in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries,[48] in order to
achieve even heat distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked
directly on a barbecue grill. Some types, such as Sicilian pizza , are baked in a pan rather than
directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.
Most restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their pizzas.
Mass production  of pizza by chains  can be completely automated.

The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according to style—thin as in a typical
hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza  or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style . It is traditionally plain, but
may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is
sometimes referred to as the cornicione .[49] Some pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise
and enhance browning of the crust.[50]
Mozzarella  is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella  produced in the surroundings
of Naples.[51] Other cheeses are also used, particularly burrata , Gorgonzola , provolone , pecorino
romano , ricotta , and scamorza . Less expensive processed cheeses  or cheese analogues  have beenCrust
Cheese developed for mass-market  pizzas to produce desirable qualities such as browning, melting,
stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal
and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of
vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured  whey proteins, and other changes in
manufacture. In 1997, it was estimat ed that annual production of pizza cheese was 1 million metric
tons (1,100,000 short tons) in the US and 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons) in Europe.[52]
A great number of pizza varieties exist, defined by the choice of toppings and sometimes also crust.

Authentic Neapolitan pizza  (Italian: pizza napoletana ) is
made with San Marzano tomatoes , grown on the volcanic
plains south of Mount Vesuvius , and either mozzarella di
bufala campana , made with milk from water buffalo raised
in the marshlands of Campania  and Lazio ,[55] or fior di
latte .[56] Buffalo mozzarella is protected with its own
European protected designation of origin  (PDO).[55] Other
traditional pizzas include pizza marinara , supposedly the
most ancient tomato-topped pizza,[57] pizza capricciosa ,
which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked ham,
mushroom, artichoke, and tomato.[58]
A popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza  (locally
called sfincione  or sfinciuni ),[59][60] a thick-crust or deep-
dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily : it is
essentially a focaccia  that is typically topped with tomato
sauce and other ingredients. Until the 1860s, sfincione  was the type of pizza usually consumed in
Sicily, especially in the Western port ion of the island.[61] Other variations of pizzas are also found
in other regions of Italy, for example pizza al padellino  or pizza al tegamino , a small-sized, thick-
crust, deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin , Piedmont.[62][63][64]
The first pizzeria in the US was opened in New York City's Little Italy  in 1905.[65] Common
toppings for pizza in the United States include anchovies , ground beef, chicken, ham, mushrooms,
olives, onions, peppers, pepperoni , pineapple, salami, sausage, spinach, steak, and tomatoes.

Thirteen percent of the United States population consumes
pizza on any given day.[68] Pizza chains  such as Domino's
Pizza , Pizza Hut, and Papa John's , pizzas from take and bake
pizzerias , and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make
pizza readily available nationwide.
Argentine pizza  is a mainstay of the country's cuisine ,[69]
especially of its capital Buenos Aires , where it is regarded as a
cultural heritage  and icon  of the city.[70][71][72] Argentina is the
country with the most pizzerias per inhabitant in the world
and, although they are consumed throughout the country, the
highest concentration of pizzerias and customers is Buenos
Aires, the city with the highest consumption of pizzas in the
world (estimated in 2015 to be 14 million per year).[73] As such,
the city has been considered as one of the world capitals of
pizza.[71][73] The dish was introduced to Buenos Aires in the
late 19th century with the massive Italian immigration , as part
of a broader great European immigration wave to the
country .[71] Thus, around the same time that the iconic pizza
Margherita[74] was being invented in Italy, pizza were already
being cooked in the Argentine capital.[75] The impoverished
Italian immigrants that arrived to the city transformed the
originally modest dish into a much more hefty meal, motivated
by the abundance of food in Argentina.[73][76] In the 1930s,
pizza was cemented as a cultural icon in Buenos Aires, with the
new pizzerias becoming a central space for sociability for the
working class  people who flocked to the city.[76][75]
The most characteristic style of Arge ntine pizza—which almost
all the classic pizzerias in Buenos Aires specialize in—is the so-called pizza de molde  (Spanish for
'pizza in the pan'), characterized by having a "thick, spongy base and elevated bready crust".[71]
This style, which today  is identified as the typical style of Argentine pizza—characterized by a thick
crust and a large amount of cheese—arose when impoverished Italian immigrants found a greater
abundance of food in then-prosperous Argentina, which motivated them to transform the
originally modest dish into a much more hefty meal suitable for a main course .[73][76] The name
pizza de molde  emerged because there were no pizza ovens in the city, so bakers resorted to baking
them in pans.[77] Since they used bakery plates, Argentine pizzas were initially square or
rectangular, a format associated with the 1920s that is still maintained in some classic pizzerias,
especially for vegetable pizzas, fugazzetas  or fugazzas .[77]
Other styles of Argentine pizza include the iconic fugazza  and its derivative fugazzeta  or fugazza
con queso  (a terminology that varies depending on the pizzeria),[71] or the pizza de cancha  or
canchera  (a cheese-less variant).[78] Most pizza menus include standard flavor combinations,Argentina Focaccia al rosmarino
Panzerottiincluding the traditional plain mozzarella, nicknamed "muza " or "musa "; the napolitana  or
"napo ", with "cheese, sliced tomatoes, garlic, dried oregano and a few green olives", not to be
confused with Neapolitan pizza ;[71] calabresa , with slices of longaniza ;[79] jamon y morrones ,
with sliced ham  and roasted bell peppers ;[71] as well as versions with provolone , with anchovies ,[79]
with hearts of palm , or with chopped hard boiled egg.[71] A typical custom that is unique to Buenos
Aires is to accompany pizza with fainá , a pancake made from chickpea flour .[80]
The terms dessert pizza  and sweet pizza  are used for a variety of dishes resembling a pizza,
including chocolate pizza  and fruit pizza .[81][82] Some are based on a traditional yeast dough pizza
base,[83] while others have a cookie -like base[84] and resemble a traditional pizza solely in having a
flat round shape with a distinct base and topping. Some pizza restaurants offer dessert
pizzas.[85][86]
Some pizzas mass-produced  by American pizza chains  have been criticized as having an unhealthy
balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt and fat, and is high in calories . The USDA  reports
an average sodium content of 5,100 mg per 14 in (36 cm) pizza in fast food chains.[87][88][89]
